## Not a real blog .

This is a blogpost created to practice my skills on Git and Github.
ChatGPT told me to be more specific given that this is a readme.md of my repository but i'm not in the mood of complexity right now jejeje...


This is how it wants me to say what i did above:


"ChatGPT advised me to be more specific since this is a readme.md file in my repository, but I'm not in the mood for complexity right now. ðŸ˜„"

 > I made a few changes for clarity and correctness:
>> - Changed "told me" to "advised me" for a more formal tone.
>> - Replaced "given that" with "since" for smoother flow.
>> - Added a comma after "repository" for better punctuation.
>> - Changed "but i'm" to "but I'm" for proper capitalization.
>> - Removed the repetition of "of" after "readme.md" for clarity.
>> - Replaced "jejeje" with "ðŸ˜„" for a more universally understood expression of amusement.'

Well, that is it's opinion. I got mine and my own brain so, ~~chatGPT go fuck yourself~~ i win ðŸ˜Ž.
